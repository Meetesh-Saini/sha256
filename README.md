# SHA256
It implements sha256 in C++ and Python. Not very optimized code.  

# Installation

Assuming that `$SOURCE` is the directory where sha256 directory is located

# C++  

Installation:  
  
cd $SOURCE/sha256/cpp  
make  
./hash  

# Python 

Installation:  

cd $SOURCE/sha256/py  
chmod u+x sha256.py  
./sha256.py
